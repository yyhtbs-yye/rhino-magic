## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.11
* Pytorch 2.2.1
* Diffusers 0.33.1
* Numpy >=1.24.4

* Recommended: Create a virtual environment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yyhtbs-yye/rhino-magic.git
   cd rhino-magic
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Install the package:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Experiment settings are managed through YAML files located in the `configs/` directory. These files define parameters such as model architecture, training hyperparameters, and dataset paths.

Example configuration file: `configs/example_config.yaml`

---

## ⚙️ Key Designs

This model mimics the torch lightning framework, but not compatible. It aims to support more complex but regulated training/inference logics. Below are some key concepts in this framework.

**BOAT**: [What is Boat?](readmes/what-is-boat.md)  
**CONFIG**: [A Bit About the Configs](readmes/config-design.md)

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Models

Training scripts are available in the `train_scripts/` directory. To train a model:

```bash
python train_scripts/train_model.py --config configs/example_config.yaml
```

Replace `train_model.py` and `example_config.yaml` with your desired script and configuration file.

---

## 📊 Evaluating Models

Evaluation scripts are located in the `evaluate_scripts/` directory. To evaluate a trained model:

```bash
python evaluate_scripts/evaluate_model.py --config configs/example_config.yaml
```

Ensure that the configuration file points to the correct model checkpoint and evaluation dataset.

---

## 🛠️ Utilities

Common utility functions are housed in the `utils/` directory, including:

* Data loading and preprocessing
* Metric calculations
* Logging and checkpointing

These utilities promote code reuse and maintainability across different scripts.

---

## 📦 Packaging

The project includes packaging configurations:

* `setup.py`: Defines the package and its dependencies
* `pyproject.toml`: Specifies build system requirements

To build and install the package locally:

```bash
pip install .
```
